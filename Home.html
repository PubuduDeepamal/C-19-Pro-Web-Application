							<h2>Whart is a corona virus ?</h2>
			
							<p>Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.
							In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe
							diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently
							discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.</p>

							<h2>How does COVID-19 spread ?</h2>
			
							<p>People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets
							from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces
							around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
							People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is
							why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick. WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways
							COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share updated findings.</p>

							<h2>Whart are symptoms of COVID-19 ?</h2>
			
							<p>The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains,
							nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people 
							become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease
							without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops
							difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems 
							or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.</p>

							<h2>Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?</h2>
			
							<p>Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather
							than through the air. See previous answer on “How does COVID-19 spread?”</p>
